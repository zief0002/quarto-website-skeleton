I live with my sister (Sadie) and my brother (Hank). I love to eat, sleep, and walk. My favorite people are: anyone with treats, the postal delivery person, the Amazon delivery person, the UPS delivery person, and Goldy. In my spare time I enjoy pulling the stuffing out of toys and dribbling water all over the house."
